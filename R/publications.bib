  abstract = {Distribution systems are supplying many customers with electricity requiring a high number of equipment and lines. It is tedious to analyze all low-voltage (LV) networks of a distribution system operator (DSO). Because of the large number of LV-networks within the system benchmark networks are required. For bulk analysis the networks have to represent a large number of networks within the system. For extreme value analysis the most critical networks have to be identified and examined. Benchmark networks representing typical LVnetworks for bulk analysis can be derived from technical data of these networks using multivariate methods. This paper describes the data allocation and application of cluster analysis for this purpose. The presented benchmark networks are based on German conditions. The networks are also reviewed under the aspect of feasibility. The benchmark networks are characterized by their supply obligation as well as the network data and properties are given for benchmark analysis. The paper also includes the diverse experience in data allocation, analysis of the data and gives assistants for prospective data allocation combined with cluster analysis of LV-networks. With the information given in the paper also benchmark networks adapted to a variety of other applications can be derived.},

  abstract = {Power quality levels in public Low Voltage (LV) grids are mainly influenced by the network, connected consumers, the connected generating installations and climatic conditions. The connected consumers (consumer topology) are expected to have a high influence on power quality (PQ) levels. Continuous phenomena like harmonics are closely linked to a one-day-cycle, which means a more or less periodic behavior of the continuous PQ parameters. Consumer topologies like office buildings or residential areas differ in their harmonic emitting behavior. Therefore, time series analysis is a suitable tool to derive factors which allow distinguishing between different consumer topologies. The paper starts with an explanation of relevant factors influencing power quality. It furthermore describes the extensive measurement campaign, set up in order to get the necessary power quality data for the identification of the correlations. Afterwards, the paper introduces a method based on the additive component model to distinguish between different consumer topologies. Finally, the suitability of the method is presented by several example applications.},

  abstract = {Power quality (PQ) is an increasing concern in the distribution networks of modern industrialized countries. The PQ monitoring activities of distribution system operators (DSO), and consequently the amount of PQ measurement data, continuously increase, and consequently new and automated tools are required for efficient PQ analysis. Time characteristics of PQ parameters (e.g., harmonics) usually show characteristic daily and weekly cycles, mainly caused by the usage behaviour of electric devices. In this paper, methods are proposed for the classification of harmonic emission profiles for typical consumer configurations in public low voltage (LV) networks using a binary decision tree in combination with support vector machines. The performance of the classification was evaluated based on 40 different measurement sites in German public LV grids. This method can support network operators in the identification of consumer configurations and the early detection of fundamental changes in harmonic emission behaviour. This enables, for example, assistance in resolving customer complaints or supporting network planning by managing PQ levels using typical harmonic emission profiles.},

Probabilistic simulation are used to obtain realistic distributions for important grid-related parameters like short circuit power. The results are presented separately for the low voltage (LV), medium voltage (MV), and high voltage (HV) grids. Based on the results, a set of reference networks for German LV, MV, and HV grids is proposed.},

  abstract = {In the last years voltage quality in the supply networks becomes more and more important for the distribution network operators (DNO). Moreover the interest of the European regulatory authorities (CEER) in voltage quality increases constantly over the last years. Due to the mentioned facts the number of power quality measurement campaigns and consequently the number of permanently installed power quality measurement instruments is growing continuously. To ensure the necessary accuracy of the measurement instruments, periodic accuracy verification is required. If the verification fails, the measurement instrument must be re-calibrated. Usually for both verification and calibration the measurement instrument must be send to the manufacturer. Especially in the case of a large number of permanently installed measurement instruments this is timeand cost-intensive and causes unwanted interruptions of the power quality measurements for several days or weeks. Maybe for this reason in many cases a measurement instrument is calibrated only sporadic or not at all. The paper describes an automated test system for accuracy verification of a specific power quality measurement instrument according to parts of EN 61000-4-30. The tests run automatically and are designed to be carried out \dbend in the field\dbend{} without dismounting the measurement instrument. In the actual stage the project was realized as \dbend proof of concept\dbend{} in co-operation with a test equipment manufacturer and a measurement instrument manufacturer.},
